      <li>How many stops are in the database. <br><br>select count(*) from stops</li>
      <li>Find the id value for the stop 'Craiglockhart' <br><br>Select id from stops where name='Craiglockhart'</li>
      <li>Give the id and the name for the stops on the '4' 'LRT' service.<br><br>Select stops.* from stops join route on id=stop where company='LRT' and num='4'</li>
      <li>The query shown gives the number of routes that visit either London Road (149) or Craiglockhart (53). Run the query and notice the two services that link these stops have a count of 2. Add a HAVING clause to restrict the output to these two routes. <br><br>SELECT company, num, COUNT(*)
FROM route WHERE stop in(149,53)
GROUP BY company, num having count(*)=2</li>
<li>Execute the self join shown and observe that b.stop gives all the places you can get to from Craiglockhart, without changing routes. Change the query so that it shows the services from Craiglockhart to London Road. <br><br>SELECT a.company, a.num, a.stop, b.stop
FROM route a JOIN route b ON
  (a.company=b.company AND a.num=b.num)
WHERE a.stop=53 and b.stop=149</li>
<li>The query shown is similar to the previous one, however by joining two copies of the stops table we can refer to stops by name rather than by number. Change the query so that the services between 'Craiglockhart' and 'London Road' are shown. If you are tired of these places try 'Fairmilehead' against 'Tollcross' <br><br>SELECT a.company, a.num, stopa.name, stopb.name
FROM route a JOIN route b ON
  (a.company=b.company AND a.num=b.num)
  JOIN stops stopa ON (a.stop=stopa.id)
  JOIN stops stopb ON (b.stop=stopb.id)
WHERE stopa.name='Craiglockhart' and stopb.name='London Road'</li>
<li>Give a list of all the services which connect stops 115 and 137 ('Haymarket' and 'Leith') <br><br>select distinct r1.company,r1.num from route r1 join route r2 on (r1.company=r2.company and r1.num=r2.num) where r1.stop=115 and r2.stop=137</li>
<li>Give a list of the services which connect the stops 'Craiglockhart' and 'Tollcross' <br><br>select distinct r1.company,r1.num from route r1 join route r2 on (r1.company=r2.company and r1.num=r2.num) join stops s1 on s1.id=r1.stop join stops s2 on s2.id=r2.stop where s1.name='Craiglockhart' and s2.name='Tollcross'</li>
<li>Give a distinct list of the stops which may be reached from 'Craiglockhart' by taking one bus, including 'Craiglockhart' itself, offered by the LRT company. Include the company and bus no. of the relevant services. <br><br>Select distinct s2.name,r2.company, r2.num from route r1 join route r2 on (r1.num=r2.num and r1.company=r2.company) join stops s1 on s1.id=r1.stop join stops s2 on s2.id=r2.stop where r2.company='LRT' and s1.name='Craiglockhart'</li>
<li>Find the routes involving two buses that can go from Craiglockhart to Lochend.
Show the bus no. and company for the first bus, the name of the stop for the transfer,
and the bus no. and company for the second bus. <br><br>Select distinct firstbus.num, firstbus.company, name, secondbus.num, secondbus.company from (Select stop.* from route start join route stop on (start.num=stop.num and start.company=stop.company and start.stop!=stop.stop) where start.stop=(Select id from stops where name='Craiglockhart')) firstbus join (Select start.* from route start join route stop on (start.num=stop.num and start.company=stop.company and start.stop!=stop.stop) where stop.stop=(Select id from stops where name='Lochend')) secondbus on firstbus.stop=secondbus.stop join stops on firstbus.stop=id
