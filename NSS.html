  <li>The example shows the number who responded for:

question 1
at 'Edinburgh Napier University'
studying '(8) Computer Science'
Show the the percentage who STRONGLY AGREE <br><br>SELECT a_strongly_agree
  FROM nss
 WHERE question='Q01'
   AND institution='Edinburgh Napier University'
   AND subject='(8) Computer Science' <br><br></li>
   <li>Show the institution and subject where the score is at least 100 for question 15. <br><br>SELECT institution, subject
  FROM nss
 WHERE question='Q15'
   AND score >= 100 <br><br></li>
   <li>Show the institution and score where the score for '(8) Computer Science' is less than 50 for question 'Q15' <br><br>SELECT institution,score
  FROM nss
 WHERE question='Q15'
   AND score<50
   AND subject='(8) Computer Science' <br><br></li>
   <li>Show the subject and total number of students who responded to question 22 for each of the subjects '(8) Computer Science' and '(H) Creative Arts and Design'. <br><br>SELECT subject, SUM(response)
  FROM nss
 WHERE question='Q22'
   AND (subject='(8) Computer Science' OR subject='(H) Creative Arts and Design')
GROUP BY subject;
 <br><br></li>
 <li>Show the subject and total number of students who A_STRONGLY_AGREE to question 22 for each of the subjects '(8) Computer Science' and '(H) Creative Arts and Design'. <br><br>SELECT subject, SUM(response*a_strongly_agree/100) FROM nss WHERE question='Q22'
  AND (subject='(8) Computer Science' OR subject='(H) Creative Arts and Design')
GROUP BY subject; <br><br></li>
<li>Show the percentage of students who A_STRONGLY_AGREE to question 22 for the subject '(8) Computer Science' show the same figure for the subject '(H) Creative Arts and Design'.
<br><br> SELECT subject, round(sum(response*a_strongly_agree)/sum(response),0) FROM nss WHERE question='Q22'
  AND (subject='(8) Computer Science' OR subject='(H) Creative Arts and Design')
GROUP BY subject; <br><br></li>
<li>Show the average scores for question 'Q22' for each institution that include 'Manchester' in the name.

The column score is a percentage - you must use the method outlined above to multiply the percentage by the response and divide by the total response. Give your answer rounded to the nearest whole number. <br><br>SELECT institution,round(sum(score*response)/sum(response),0) score
  FROM nss
 WHERE question='Q22'
   AND (institution LIKE '%Manchester%')
Group BY institution <br><br></li>
<li>Show the institution, the total sample size and the number of computing students for institutions in Manchester for 'Q01' <br><br>SELECT n1.institution, sum(n1.sample), (Select n2.sample from nss n2 where n2.subject='(8) Computer Science' and n1.institution=n2.institution and question ='Q01') comp FROM nss n1 WHERE question='Q01' AND (institution LIKE '%Manchester%') group by institution <br><br></li>
